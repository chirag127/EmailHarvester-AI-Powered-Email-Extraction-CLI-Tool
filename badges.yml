# Note: The `badges.yml` file itself is typically processed by a CI/CD pipeline
# or a documentation generation tool. The `base_url` variable here is primarily
# for configuration and potential templating if this file were to be used
# within a larger system. For direct README generation, the URLs would be hardcoded
# as per the README requirements.
